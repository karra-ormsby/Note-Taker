# Note-Taker

## Description

Given some front-end starter code for a note taking application, I have added back-end code to give the application the ability to save notes in a file, get the saved notes so they can be displayed by the webpage, and delete a note when the delete button is pressed.

This application is deployed using Heroku. No installation is needed. To use the application visit https://note-taker-ko.herokuapp.com/notes.

The website is a note taking app. Once you load the page click the "Get Started" button to be taken the the notes page.

On the left you will see the titles of the notes that have already been saved,

and on the right you will see a space where you can type in a new note.

Clicking on any note on the left hand side will open it up on the right so that you can see both the note title and note text.

If you have a saved note open you can click the plus icon in the top right hand corner to start writing a new note.

You will be unable to save your new note until you have text entered in both the note title and note text fields. Once you have entered in the necessary information a save button will appear and you will be able to save your note.

To delete a note just click on the red trash can next to the note you want to delete.
